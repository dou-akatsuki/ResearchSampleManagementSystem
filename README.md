# ResearchSampleManagementSystem

Demos <br />
  nedb-demo-v1: <br />
    - includes basic CRUD operations for samples and nodes <br />
    - works well although the table sometimes doesn't render properly and alerts come up unexpectedly <br />
  nedb-demo-v2: <br />
    - only create attribute, create sampleID and process one sample, giving one attribute works <br />
    - Much code copied from v1 but not in use <br />
  JSONTree <br />
    - shows tree from hard-coded data <br />
