Demos
  nedb-demo-v1:
    - includes basic CRUD operations for samples and nodes
    - works well although the table sometimes doesn't render properly and alerts come up unexpectedly
  nedb-demo-v2:
    - only create attribute, create sampleID and process one sample, giving one attribute works
    - Much code copied from v1 but not in use
  JSONTree
    - shows tree from hard-coded data
    - last demo received from Alex (7/05/2016)
